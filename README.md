# loomomakeathon
This is a project to make a tour at uw makerspace for uw makeathon competition. We build this software based on the VLSsample code giveb by segway.com, the producer of loomo.
However, we change most of the components and used speaker and pose 2D to realize the function.
Hope someone might need it...
